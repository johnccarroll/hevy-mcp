Please build out a full Model Context Protocol server to use with the API documented in the JSON. I want all the possible tooling possible and use every api call here. Include a test directory as well with a simple integration test for the client as well as MCP test suites per-tool. Here is my API Key, that will be an environment variable for the MCP. Use typescript for this implementation.
